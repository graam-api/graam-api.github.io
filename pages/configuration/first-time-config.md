title: First steps in setting up your Smartcontact call center
---

## Welcome to Smartcontact

When you first login with your admin account, you are presented with this admin console.

You will use this console to get an overview of current activities of your call center. We will get back on this later. Now, let's do the configuration first.


## Test your phone number

Click on the menu item "My Numbers", then click on the phone number in the list to get to this page:

When your enterprise is created, a phone number is attributed to your account and is configured to be routed to a call queue. You can call the phone number (using your mobile phone for example) to make sure that you can hear the waiting music of the call queue. 

You can make experiments by changing the destination of the call to see the different available options. Here are some of them:
- Transfer the call to some external number
- Enter a call conference
- Call an IVR

## Connect your SIP phone

In order to make outbound call with Smartcontact, you must connect a SIP phone to your account. Smartcontact use the standard SIP protocol so you can use any SIP phone to connect to it. Here are some well known SIP (soft) phone that you can download and use on your PC to test.
- [Zoiper](https://www.zoiper.com/)
- [XLite from Counterpath](http://www.counterpath.com/x-lite/)

However, for professional call center use, we recommend using desktop IP phone for more stability.

Follow instructions from the image bellow to get SIP account information for each user:
